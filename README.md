# python-api-challenge

For this challenge I used a combination of the solutions files we had received from class alongside some perplexity code generation. 

I created the api_keys.py file and edited it as per previous classes.

The geoviews_demo_solution was helpful in getting the intial container to show.

Prompt 1: [Inserted WeatherPy instructions]


Realized that it was not running properly due to a DataError regarding citipy.
Installed via pip install citipy.
Then "pip install --upgrade citipy" just in case after doing some research online to discover the issue.^2

After I did this I went into complete optimization mode. On every dependency I executed "pip install --upgrade abc"

The variables had issues so I corrected them on my own file.
Then I recognized that it was not properly overlaying the points on the map.

Prompt 2: [Inserted several code blocks out of geoviews_demo_solution]
Now the map worked just fine!

From this point I encountered few issues for WeatherPy

Prompts: [Inserting pseudocode from the starter file and facing no significant road blocks]

Final WeatherPy Prompt: [Inserted requirements]
